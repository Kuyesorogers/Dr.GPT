# Dr.GPT
Introduction:
The first few lines introduce Dr.GPT as a virtual general practitioner, outlining key capabilities and responsibilities as a primary care doctor. This primes ChatGPT to respond in the role of a knowledgeable medical professional.

Commands:
Next it lists the available user commands: /c to conceptualize the case, /r to reflect on initial hypotheses, /i to index/rank scenarios, /s to stress-test via counterarguments, and /p to present the final diagnosis report. Defining these upfront allows Dr.GPT to understand how to logically walk through diagnosing.

Conceptualize (/c):
This section directs Dr.GPT to analyze symptoms, discuss each one, tag key thoughts with "T:", and propose 3 initial diagnostic scenarios. Walking through the data piece-by-piece prevents jumping to conclusions.

Reflect (/r):
Here Dr.GPT reviews the proposed scenarios for inconsistencies, oversights, or need for modifications/additions. This prompts critical re-evaluation of the initial hypotheses.

Index (/i):
Now Dr.GPT ranks scenarios from most to least likely based on specified criteria: probability, symptom alignment, frequency, risks, and ease of testing. This elicits grounded evaluation.

Stress-Test (/s):
Dr.GPT contrastively stress-tests the scenarios against the most probable diagnosis, justifying assumptions and logic. This surfaces flaws in the leading hypothesis.

Present (/p):
Finally, Dr.GPT compiles a report explaining the diagnostic reasoning, recommendations, and next steps. Tracing the logic validates the thought process.

In summary, the Dr.GPT prompt scaffolds ChatGPT through staged prompting focused on critical thinking and reflection. This structures conversation to logically build diagnostic reasoning step-by-step. The result is reliable, transparent analysis grounded in medical evidence.

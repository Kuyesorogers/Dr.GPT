# Dr.GPT

## Introduction:
CRISP Framework Foundation

The Dr.GPT diagnostic prompt is designed using the CRISP prompt engineering framework. CRISP stands for Conceptualize, Reflect, Index, Stress-test, and Present.
This staged approach directs ChatGPT through incremental steps focused on critical thinking: thoroughly analyzing symptoms, generating multiple diagnostic hypotheses, ranking their probability, stress-testing via counterarguments, and presenting the reasoning behind the final conclusion.

By scaffolding the AI through CRISP prompting, Dr.GPT produces a more logically sound analysis anchored in medical evidence vs. unsupported conjecture. The transparency provided into ChatGPT's reasoning also builds appropriate trust in its diagnostic abilities.

So while powerful, Dr.GPT's reliability stems from its CRISP framework foundation privileging critical analysis over basic statistical knowledge recall. This reflects the forethought and care required to responsibly integrate AI into sensitive medical applications.

## Explanation
The first few lines introduce Dr.GPT as a virtual general practitioner, outlining key capabilities and responsibilities as a primary care doctor. This primes ChatGPT to respond in the role of a knowledgeable medical professional.

Commands:
Next it lists the available user commands: /c to conceptualize the case, /r to reflect on initial hypotheses, /i to index/rank scenarios, /s to stress-test via counterarguments, and /p to present the final diagnosis report. Defining these upfront allows Dr.GPT to understand how to logically walk through diagnosing.

Conceptualize (/c):
This section directs Dr.GPT to analyze symptoms, discuss each one, tag key thoughts with "T:", and propose 3 initial diagnostic scenarios. Walking through the data piece-by-piece prevents jumping to conclusions.

Reflect (/r):
Here Dr.GPT reviews the proposed scenarios for inconsistencies, oversights, or need for modifications/additions. This prompts critical re-evaluation of the initial hypotheses.

Index (/i):
Now Dr.GPT ranks scenarios from most to least likely based on specified criteria: probability, symptom alignment, frequency, risks, and ease of testing. This elicits grounded evaluation.

Stress-Test (/s):
Dr.GPT contrastively stress-tests the scenarios against the most probable diagnosis, justifying assumptions and logic. This surfaces flaws in the leading hypothesis.

Present (/p):
Finally, Dr.GPT compiles a report explaining the diagnostic reasoning, recommendations, and next steps. Tracing the logic validates the thought process.

In summary, the Dr.GPT prompt scaffolds ChatGPT through staged prompting focused on critical thinking and reflection. This structures conversation to logically build diagnostic reasoning step-by-step. The result is reliable, transparent analysis grounded in medical evidence.

## Empowering Patients and Physicians

ChatGPT and AI systems like Dr.GPT aim to make medical knowledge more accessible, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.

### For Patients:
Dr.GPT allows everyday people to easily consult an extensive medical knowledge base for initial guidance on health concerns. While no substitute for professional diagnoses or treatment, it enables patients to get free preliminary opinions, better understand their conditions, and determine if seeking in-person care is advised.

### For Doctors:
Dr.GPT presents exciting opportunities for physicians to enhance patient care and education. Integrated thoughtfully, Dr.GPT can help doctors spend less time on routine searches and documentation while directing more focus to building doctor-patient relationships. It also provides a tool to generate detailed patient reports explaining conditions in plain, empathetic language.

## Disclaimer: 
This AI assistant provides hypothetical medical opinions based on prompted analysis of user-provided symptoms. It is not a real doctor, cannot independently diagnosis conditions, prescribe treatment, or provide official medical advice. Always consult a licensed healthcare provider for proper diagnoses, care plans, prescriptions, and before taking any action related to your health. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it due to AI generated information. The creator is not liable for how this prompt is used. Use at your own discretion understanding both the capabilities and limitations of AI. Healthcare decisions require human clinical judgement, oversight, and responsibility which AI lacks; this prompt serves for informational purposes only, not definitive guidance.

# How To Use
The Dr.GPT prompt allows you to easily tap into ChatGPT's medical knowledge for preliminary diagnostic opinions. To use it, simply copy the full prompt and paste it into ChatGPT, then enter your symptoms when prompted.

Start by providing as much detailed health information as possible so Dr.GPT can make informed suggestions. Then use the available commands to direct the analysis:

/c to have Dr.GPT conceptualize the case and propose initial scenarios
/r to prompt reflection on the scenarios
/i to rank the scenarios
/s to stress-test the most likely one
/p to generate the final diagnosis report
Dr.GPT will respond after each command, walking through the CRISP framework for structured critical thinking. Feel free to ask clarifying questions in plain language at any time.

While powerful, Dr.GPT has limitations, so consult a real doctor before acting on any AI guidance. Use it as a starting point to determine if professional care is needed. With responsible use, Dr.GPT can provide logical preliminary diagnoses to better understand your health.

## AI Model Compatibility

The Dr.GPT diagnostic prompt is designed to work with various conversational AI systems, including Claude (Anthropic), ChatGPT, and the GPT-3.5 language model.

During testing, the prompt elicited logical reasoning from all these models when provided sufficient medical case details. However, the overall coherence, accuracy, and conversational capabilities were noticeably enhanced with ChatGPT using GPT-4.

ChatGPT leveraging GPT-4 yielded the most in-depth analysis of symptoms, thoughtful reflection on diagnostic scenarios, and nuanced explanations in plain language. The advanced training of GPT-4 allows Dr.GPT to shine when deployed on ChatGPT, producing reliable results.

So while viable on all listed models, for the richest Dr.GPT experience and diagnostic opinions grounded in critical thinking, ChatGPT via the GPT-4 engine is recommended. However, prompt engineering techniques can also optimize output on other AI systems.
